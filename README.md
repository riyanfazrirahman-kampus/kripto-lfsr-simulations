# LFSR Simulation with Streamlit

This project implements a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) simulation that converts the first character of a name to its ASCII value, transforms it into a binary string (4-8 bits), and performs an LFSR process. The feedback is calculated by XORing the first bit (bit 0) and the last bit of the state. The application is built using Python and Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

## Features

- Input a name to extract the first character and convert it to ASCII.
- Convert the ASCII value to a binary string with a selectable bit length (4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits).
- Simulate the LFSR process for a specified number of steps, generating a random output sequence.
- Display the LFSR process in a table, showing the iteration, state, feedback, new state, and output.
- Interactive web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages:
  - `streamlit`
  - `pandas`

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install streamlit pandas
```

## Project Structure

- `lfsr_functions.py`: Contains the core logic for the LFSR simulation, including:

  - `validate_name`: Extracts the first character of a name and converts it to uppercase.
  - `char_to_ascii`: Converts a character to its ASCII value.
  - `decimal_to_binary`: Converts a decimal number to a binary string with specified bit length.
  - `xor_bits`: Performs XOR operation on a list of bits (used for feedback calculation).
  - `lfsr_simulation`: Simulates the LFSR process, XORing the first and last bits of the state.

- `lfsr_streamlit.py`: Implements the Streamlit web interface for user interaction, displaying inputs and results.
- `README.md`: This file, providing project documentation.

## Usage

1. Ensure both `lfsr_functions.py` and `lfsr_streamlit.py` are in the same directory.
2. Run the Streamlit application:

```sh
streamlit run lfsr_streamlit.py
```

3. Open the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) in your web browser.
4. In the web interface:
   - Enter a name (e.g., "Riyan").
   - Select the bit length (4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits).
   - Specify the number of LFSR steps (1 to 100).
   - Click "Run Simulation" to view the results, including:
     - Name, first character, ASCII value, and binary initial state.
     - A table showing the LFSR process (iteration, state, feedback, new state, output).
     - The random output sequence generated by the LFSR.
